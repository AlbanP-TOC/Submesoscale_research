## Spectrum extraction
- OGCM_to_EDS create standardised csv files for OGCMs spectrums (here GLORYS is used).

- Simulation_to_EDS converts the resulting file of a simulation to a succession of spectrums in a standardised file.

- The standardised spectrum files are stored in the comparison_spectrum file 

- Both resulting files can be opened to be compared in the Spectrum_comparison file.


## Measures
- Simulation_measures computes the energy, enstrophy, taylor microscale and Reynolds of a given Spectrum file
