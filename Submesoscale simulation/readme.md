EDS_GLORYS create standardised csv files for GLORYS spectrums.

Simulation_to_EDS converts the resulting file of a simulation to a succession of spectrums in a standardised file.

The standardised spectrum files are stored in the comparison_spectrum file 

Both resulting files can be opened to be compared in the Spectrum_comparison file.



Simulation_to_energy computes the energy, enstrophy and vorticity of a given simulation file and creates a standardised file

Not added : Energy_GLORYS will create a plot a the energy enstrophy and vorticity similar to Simulation_to_energy.

The energy, enstrophy and vorticity plot are stored in the comparison_energy file.


Turbulence development aims at studying the time it takes for the flow to become turbulent.
