## Spectrum extraction
-EDS_GLORYS create standardised csv files for GLORYS spectrums.

-Simulation_to_EDS converts the resulting file of a simulation to a succession of spectrums in a standardised file.

-The standardised spectrum files are stored in the comparison_spectrum file 

-Both resulting files can be opened to be compared in the Spectrum_comparison file.


## Measures
Simulation_measures computes the energy, enstrophy, taylor microscale and Reynolds of a given Spectrum file

Not added : OGCM_measures will create a plot Simulation_measures.
